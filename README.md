# Implementations
This is a Repository that contains implementation of many different important Algorithms that I have implemented in different subjects and interdisciplinary domain.

1) Polygon Triangulation Algorithm -> This folder contains the implementation of the Polygon Triangulation Algorithm in O(n*n) in C++. This algorithm is used in many industrial methods as a preprocseeing step.
2) NSGA II Optmization(Genetic Algorithm) -> This contains the implementation of NSGA II Algorithm which is used as an Optimization Algorithm to evalutate better Machine Process Parameters, and hence outputs the best Machine Optimized Output where we start the process as an random population of measurements.
